Using JavaScript to interact with an app is important because the language in itself is how we make websites functional for the user. For example, if I need a counter to keep track of how many times a button is clicked, JavaScript can help. By learning about DOM interactions, my understanding of HOW JavaScript connects to a web page was greatly clarified. Learning new methods were always difficult to understand at first, but with practice these exercises gave me a mind to willingly create and edit custom functionalities for web pages. 
     I feel like my biggest accomplishment in this course was being able to actually connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create custom web pages. As a result of this course, I feel more confident in how web pages are designed and customly made interactive.
